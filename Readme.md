# Color scheme switcher

This is a quick demo of cookie-based CSS theme switching functionality without
running any client-side (browser) JS code. Server-side rendering only, just
`express` + `pug`.

## Build and run

```
npm i
npm start
```

Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and tinker with it.
